Traveling Salesman Problem Using Excel &amp; Python
Imagine you're a salesman. You need to visit a list of cities to sell your products. You start in your home city, visit each city exactly once, and then return home. The challenge is to find the shortest possible route that lets you do this.


Suppose our company, based in Abilene, Texas, needs to transport shipments to 13 other cities within Texas and then return to Abilene. Our objective is to find the optimal route that minimizes the transportation costs while ensuring that each city is visited exactly once before returning to Abilene.

The distance matrix was calculated using Euclidean distances derived from the longitude and latitude coordinates of each city. In this matrix, each entry represents the straight-line distance between two cities. The zeros that appear in
the matrix are located on the diagonal, where the row and column correspond to the same city, indicating that the distance from a city to itself is zero. The other numbers in the matrix represent the distances between different cities. For
example, the distance between Abilene and Amarillo is 266 km. Our journey will start from Abilene, visiting all 13 other cities, and then returning to Abilene at the end.
